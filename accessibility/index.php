					<h2>How did we choose these keys?</h2>
					<p>The use of numbered keys and 's' as access keys have been selected based on research done by<a href="http://www.wats.ca/" title="Link to external website: WATS" target="_blank">WATS.ca</a>&nbsp;that shows minimal conflict with browser reserved shortcut keys.</p>
